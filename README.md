Shits and Giggles projects.  Written for the MS C compiler present in Visual Studio 2012.

A bunch of stupid things I've put together.  Currently contains:

1.  A generic radix tree implementation that I used as a way of familiarizing myself with some of MSVC's quirks and their development environment.  It's kind of tested and can be considered in its alpha stages.  A testing framework comes with it.  There is no Makefile -- if you want a hacked-up radix tree in C in its alpha stages, you're probably a big enough kid to write your own for a single .c and .h file.

2.  The read-maybe hashtable.  Written as a joke.  Compiles, but untested.  Although what good testing would do, I have no idea.
