Shits and Giggles projects

A bunch of stupid things I've put together.  Currently contains:

1.  A generic radix tree implementation that I used as a way of familiarizing myself with some of MSVC's quirks and their development environment.  It's not really fully tested yet.  No, there is no Makefile as of yet.
